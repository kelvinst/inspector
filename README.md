# Inspector

A simple module that allows a more friendly debugging experience

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `inspector` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:inspector, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

## TODO

- [] Make it less verbose, providing an module alias that allows something like: `use I; i`
- [] Make it emmit a warning if used in production builds
